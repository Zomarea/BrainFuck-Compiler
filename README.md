# BrainFuck-Compiler
This is a compiler for the "BrainFuck" language in Python (currently no loops)

# How to use :
Simply download the "compiler.py" file and place that in any folder on your system. Then, make a new text file in the same folder - in that text file, write your Brainfuck code. When you're ready, run the compiler.py and once it runs it should ask for a file to load - all you need to do is write the name of your file in the console and enter. After that type "compile" into the console and your code should execute.

# Update :
(30/5/15) I've just made a JavaScript version of this, it works in the browser and works entirely (excluding the ','). So, I'll probably be remaking this Python version around that one.
